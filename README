A collection of patches for Open Source Software helps to keep
all the fixes together, visible, and verifiable.

There are often times when patches can easily live in a gist,
but now and then the source code contains mixed line endings.
Because web browsers filter those out, the patch will fail.

Here they can be uploaded directly, skipping the paste.
Enjoy!
